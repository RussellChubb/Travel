# Spain

## Summary

### Overview

- **Visited:** December 23rd (2022) - 15th January 2023
- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Regions:** Barcelona (*Central & Terresa*), Cadaqués , Girona, L'Escala

### Why I went

- I went over to Spain as my brother girlfrieI'nd invited my family over to spend Christmas with them. (*Also a good opportunity for our families to meet*)

### Highlights

- Mount Serat
- Sunset over Barcelona at lookout point that I forget the name of.
- Christmas in Terasa
- Eating 21 Snails

### Lowlights

- Almost getting lost in the mountains of Mont Serrat in the dark.
  - Lesson from this being that if Rian asks to go for a walk, say no ;)
  - This is lowkey a highlight as well lol.

### Food & Drink

- All the food over there was elite, in particular, I still think about the padron peppers and this rib dish I got. Holy moly that was good.

### Getting Around

- Train System was really organized and easy to use.
- Also rented a car, which once you get used to driving on the wrong side of the road, isn't so bad.

### Costs

- I wouldn't say that anything caught me out here, obvioulsy the translation from Kiwi-Bux ($NZD) to Euro's can burn a bit, but yeah nothing crazy.

### Cultural Notes

- Big one is that  in some places, they really like to call it Catalonia, as opposed to Spain. Me and my brother got some stick from an old dude in an elevator because we called it Spain, instead of Catalonia.
  - **NOTE:** I'm glossing over a tonne here.
- Obvioulsy they do Siesta over there in Spain, so stores are closed between 2:00PM - 5:00PM. To be honest, I really liked this, just get amongst it and have a sleep during those hours haha.
- I didn't realise how late they party lol, I started drinking at 6:00PM with some Argentinians and they were so confused. They tell me that they normally start drinking at 8 - 9:00 PM and then finish at 7:00 AM

### What I’d Do Differently

- I only wished I'd stayed in Spain longer and explored other regions.

### Tips for Future Me

- Stay longer, explore more regions!
- Invest even more time in my Duolingo.

### Rating

- **Overall:** 8.5 / 10
- **Would return:** Yes

## Write-Up

I went over to Spain on December 23rd travelling with flights going from:

- WLG -> SYD -> DXB - BCN

The original reason for coming over, (*other than to explore Spain*) was for me and my family to spend Christmas with my brothers then Girfriend (*now Fiancee' soon to be wife*) and to meet her family.

I arrived fairly jet-lagged (*but honestly not that jet-lagged*).

I spent the first week in Central Barcelona, bascially just walking around various restraunts, art museums, the beach and some clubs and bars.

We had to of course go to La Sagrada Familia,  which I'll casully admit was one of the craziest things I've ever seen before in my life, and it makes me marvel at the creation of man.

We then went to Terrassa, which is a small city outside of central Barcelona where Maria's (*Brothers Girlfriend*) family lived.

We then spent Christmas day with their family which was a super awesome experience. The only thing that I'm still stumped on, and I don't know if they were pulling my leg or not, was that they said they have a traditional where they watch the Olympic Ski Jumping (*the one where the fling themselves off a ramp*) each Christmas.

After that, we went to Mont Serrat, which is a village high in the Spanish mountains, complete with a Monastery and Monks!

- Walked around the various tracks and looked at the relgious art.
